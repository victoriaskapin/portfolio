        <h1> Hello, I'm Victoria</h1>
        <p> I’m a software developer with 4 years of professional experience across a wide range of technologies.
            While I consider myself a jack of all trades, I’ve worked on everything from embedded systems and Arduino, to frontend development, REST API hosting, and more recently, data engineering and large language models.
            Let’s connect if you’d like to learn more about what I do!
